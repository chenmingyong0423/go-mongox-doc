# Query Package
The `query` package offers a straightforward approach for building `MongoDB` query conditions. It includes an array of functions and builders designed to simplify the build of query conditions. For complex query conditions, builders enable flexible building through a method of chainable calls. For simpler needs, direct use of functions facilitates quick build of query conditions.
