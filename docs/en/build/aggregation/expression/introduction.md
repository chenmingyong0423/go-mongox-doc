# Aggregation Expression Builder

The aggregation expression builder is designed to facilitate the easy construction of expressions within an aggregation pipeline, such as `$add`, `$subtract`, and others.

By using `aggregation.BsonBuilder()`, you can create a new builder instance, and then call the respective methods to construct expressions.
